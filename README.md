# Potholes and Speed Bumps detection

This GitHub repository is dedicated to a project focused on detecting potholes and speed bumps using YOLOv5. The web scraping with Selenium is employed to balance an existing dataset for model training. Additionally, the project includes the development of a mobile application using Flutter and Firebase for real-time monitoring and alerting. While the repository doesn't provide the datasets or the application code, I'm available for any inquiries you might have.

## Overview

Potholes and speed bumps on roads can be a major concern for drivers and road maintenance authorities. This project aims to address this issue by creating a system that can detect and report the presence of potholes and speed bumps. The project utilizes various technologies to achieve this goal.

## Technologies Used

- **YOLOv5**: We employ the YOLOv5 model for object detection to identify potholes and speed bumps. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art real-time object detection system.
- **Selenium**: We use Selenium to scrape additional images from Google Images, contributing to dataset balance for training the detection model.
- **Flutter**: The mobile application is developed using Flutter, a popular open-source framework for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- **Firebase**: Firebase is used for real-time monitoring and alerting. It provides features such as real-time databases, cloud functions, and notifications to enhance the user experience.

## Repository Contents

This repository includes code and resources related to the YOLOv5 model and Selenium web scraping scripts, which were essential for balancing the existing dataset. However, the datasets and the application code are not provided.
